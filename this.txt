Context 'this' in JavaScript

Context in JS it's an interesting topic, but not for beginners. Because They can't realize How does 'this' behave?
And for beginners hard to understand that topic. In this article I'll try to explain you with simple tongue :)

The 'this' is a pointer who points to Object Javascript

We take 'this' in the place where we execute or call function. For pitch I'll show you the example below

For example:

`console.log(this)`; // Interesting What we will have?

That expression shows us global window. Why? We don't have function or object in prev example and Context 'this' will take in object Window 
Because It is the outermost JavaScript context.

Remember: Context only makes sense inside functions.


Error: nested function calls
